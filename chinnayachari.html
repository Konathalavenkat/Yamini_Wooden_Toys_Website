                <h2>Early Life and Training</h2>
                <p>Shri SriSailapu Chinnayachari was born in Etikoppaka, a small backward village of Visakhapatnam district in Andhra Pradesh on 27th July, 1979. From his childhood, he had a desire to popularize his family traditional craft. Shri Chinnaychari, from the tender age of 5, assisted and trained under Mr. G Suribabu, a master craftsman of the village, and C.V.Raju, a landlord who revived the use of natural dyes for this craft. At the age of 15, because of his family’s financial condition, he discontinued his schooling and started pursuing this art form professionally.</p>

                <h2>Etikoppaka Art Form and Challenges</h2>
                <p>For over a century, the Etikoppaka bowls, boxes, toys like rattles and tops were a part of the everyday life of the neighboring villages. No little girl’s toy collection was complete without the colorful ’lakkapidathalu,’ the kitchen set. So popular were they, that over a period of time, Koppaka became synonymous with Lakkapidathalu. This very popular art form faced several challenges in the recent times. The first major crisis that hit the industry was the arrival of cheap but colorful plastic articles and toys that flooded the market. To match the attractive colors of the plastic toys, the Etikoppaka artisans took to replacing the limited range of organic colors with chemical dyes. The original allure of the Etikoppaka wooden toys was that, not only were they well-rounded to suit the needs of small children but the colors were safe. Once this advantage was lost, the market for the Etikoppaka toys fell drastically. To add to their woes, the soft ankudu wood (wrightia tinctoria) used to make the toys and artifacts, became a scarce commodity due to deforestation and the forest department preventing wood collection. Inspite of these obstacles, Shri Chinnaychari continued with the age-old natural dyes for his craft as well as innovating new designs.</p>

                <h2>Contributions and Achievements</h2>
                <p>Shri Chinnayachari conducted and promoted training programs to keep the craft alive. He encouraged and empowered women to take up this art and trained nearly 100 people so far in this artform. Under his guidance, these women created 500 limited edition sculptures of Princess Pea which were displayed at Design Store, India Art Fair from 28 — 31 January 2016, New Delhi. He is actively involved in training programs and workshops on behalf of the Crafts Council. Four of his students received State awards and one was awarded National merit. At present, fifty families are earning their livelihood through him.</p>
            
                <p>He started his association with Crafts Council of Andhra Pradesh in the year 2004, and recognizing his efforts Crafts Council of India bestowed Kamala Devi Chatopadhyaya Award in the same year, for brilliantly crafting twenty-three eggs into one another.</p>
            
                <p>In 2005, he won the National Award from Development Commissioner of Handicrafts, New Delhi for furthering this to thirty-two eggs. He received this award from then President Dr A P J Abdul Kalam. Till then artisans could create only twelve eggs. Eventually in 2011, he scaled it up to fifty-one eggs and entered the Limca Book of Records, India.</p>
            
                <p>His interest grew in miniatures. He made the smallest chess board in the world with squares the size of 1.2 mm. This won him acclaim in the India Book of Records and the World Book of Records in 2012. The same year the Ministry of Textiles gave him a participating certificate as a toy maker in the Republic Day tableau representing Andhra Pradesh.</p>
            
                <p>In 2016, he made a Veena (musical instrument) on a rice grain and the Taj Mahal on a pinhead. He created two parrots on a single strand of hair and furthering the concept also made a crane and her baby. He also created a miniature of Lord Rama and Seetha's Pattabhishekam on one half of a poppy seed. He constantly strives at original creations. All these miniatures are the smallest in the world. He created micro tools for creating these miniatures. He has created the biggest (Princess Pea) and the smallest (Ram and Seetha's Pattabhishekam Wooden Sculptures fixed on Poppy seed) artworks of Etikoppaka.</p>
